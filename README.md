About Go  _(the programming language)_
--------------------------------------

From the "[_The Go Programming Language Specification_](http://golang.org/ref/spec)":

> Go is a general-purpose language designed with system programming in mind. It is strongly typed and garbage-collected and has explicit support for cocurrent programming. Programms are constructed from packages, whose properties allow efficient management dependencies. The existing implemenetation use a tradiational compile/link model to generate excutable binaries."
